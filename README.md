# 🏢 Employee Management System – SQL Project

This project demonstrates a basic **Employee Management System** using SQL. 
It includes table creation, data insertion,updates, and deletion operations in a SQL database.

## 📘 About the Project

This project creates and manages an `Employees` table inside a database called `company`. It covers:

- Creating a table with constraints and default values
- Inserting data (using both default and explicit values)
- Handling `NULL` values
- Updating existing records
- Deleting unwanted data (e.g., rows with missing values)

The goal is to practice and demonstrate **SQL DDL and DML operations**.
